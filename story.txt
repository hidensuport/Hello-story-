There is a man who really likes to dance. He just keeping dancing until he met a man.

This man's name is David. David hates dancing.
The man did not understand why.
The man tried to convince him that dancing is fun.
However, David did not dance.

David never would say why he did not want to dance, and the man never asked. 
Despite this, the two were best friends. One day, David decided to tell the man why he would never dance.

David never danced because he literally had no legs or arms. The man was blind, so
he did not realize that David has no legs or arms. David tried moving his head 
with the music but he had a neck brace. David could not move. But one day his neck brace came
off and he danced with the man all night.

At the end of the story, they just keep dacing and everybody love to dance.
